##Application Fact Sheet
Secure Pass is a web application which uses JavaScript, mainly regex, for password validation against a set of criteria chosen to increase the difficulty of passwords being broken. To use it, all you need to do is type a potential password into the input box and the requirements section will update to show whether you have included the criteria or not. As the requirements table changes to reflect your password, so will the Hue lights. The 'Clear' button will empty the input form and reset the requirements, and lights, to their default. As the webpage advises,real passwords that you are intending to use should not be entered, rather opting for a similar one. This is to prevent any malware that may be monitoring or recording input. The clear layout and usage of icons in the requirements make it easy to see what the requirements areand if they're met in your password. The information within the 'About' section gives some extra background on why strong passwords are important and talks more about the requirements chosen.

###Key Features
1. A quick and responsive design which updates quickly to show requirements being met.
2. Criteria designed on strengthening passwords.
3. Clear, aesthetic design.
4. Ticks/Crosses for users that may be partially or fully colour blind.
